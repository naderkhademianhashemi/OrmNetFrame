To generate a local resource file from an ASP.NET Web page: 

	1.Open the page for which you want to create a resource file.
	
	2.Switch to Design View.
	
	3.In the Tools menu, click Generate Local Resource. 
		Visual Web Developer creates the App_LocalResources folder if it does not already exist. 
		Visual Web Developer then creates the culturally neutral base resource file for the current page, 
		which includes a key/name pair for each control property or page property that requires localization. 
		Finally, Visual Web Developer adds a meta attribute to each ASP.NET Web server control to configure the control to use implicit localization 
			
	
	4.Type values for each resource that you need in your application, and then save the file.
	
	5.If the latest resource changes are not displayed, 
		refresh Design view by switching to Source view and then switching back to Design view.
